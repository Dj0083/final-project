# Admin Login & Authentication Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified

When navigating to "Manage Users" from the admin dashboard, you were getting an error:
**"Authentication Required, Please login first"**

Even though you were already logged in as admin!

## 🔍 Root Cause

The issue was caused by **incorrect storage method**:

1. **Your app uses**: `expo-secure-store` (SecureStore) to store tokens and user data
2. **ManageUsers.js was using**: `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` (AsyncStorage)
3. **Result**: ManageUsers couldn't find the token because it was looking in the wrong place!

### Storage Comparison:
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG (What ManageUsers.js was doing)
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
const token = await AsyncStorage.getItem('token');

// ✅ CORRECT (What your app actually uses)
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';
const token = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('token');
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Changed Storage Method**
- ❌ Removed: `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
- ✅ Added: `expo-secure-store`
- ✅ Added: `useAuth()` hook from AuthContext

### 2. **Improved Authentication Check**
Now checks TWO sources for authentication:

**Primary (Fast):** AuthContext
```javascript
if (user && user.token) {
  // User is already logged in via context
  setAuthToken(user.token);
}
```

**Fallback (Reliable):** SecureStore
```javascript
const token = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('token');
const userData = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('userData');
```

### 3. **Added Admin Role Verification**
```javascript
if (user.role !== 'admin') {
  Alert.alert('Access Denied', 'Only administrators can access this page');
  return;
}
```

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- ✅ Clear console logs for debugging
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Option to go back or login
- ✅ Detects expired sessions (401 errors)

### 5. **Enhanced Console Debugging**
Now shows helpful logs:
```
🔐 Auth Check - Using context token
👤 User Role: admin
📡 Fetching users with filter: all
🔑 Using token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
✅ Response received: Success
👥 Loaded users: 5
```

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Login Flow:
1. Admin logs in → Token stored in **SecureStore**
2. User data stored in **AuthContext** (in memory)
3. Navigate to Manage Users
4. Page checks **AuthContext first** (fast)
5. If not found, checks **SecureStore** (reliable)
6. Verifies user is admin
7. Makes API call with token
8. Success! 🎉

### Security Features:
- ✅ Token stored in **SecureStore** (encrypted)
- ✅ Admin role verification
- ✅ Session expiry detection
- ✅ Auto-redirect to login if token missing
- ✅ Access denied for non-admin users

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

1. **Login as Admin**
   - Go to login page
   - Enter admin credentials
   - Should redirect to admin dashboard ✅

2. **Navigate to Manage Users**
   - Click "Manage Users" button
   - Should load user list (no error!) ✅
   - See all users with their roles ✅

3. **Check Filtering**
   - Click "Sellers" tab → See only sellers ✅
   - Click "Investors" tab → See only investors ✅
   - Click "All" tab → See all users ✅

4. **Test Search**
   - Type a name → Filters in real-time ✅
   - Click X icon → Clears search ✅

5. **Test Approve/Reject**
   - Click on pending user ✅
   - Click "Approve" → Confirmation → Success ✅
   - Click "Reject" → Confirmation → Success ✅

6. **Test Session Handling**
   - If backend returns 401 → Shows "Session Expired" ✅
   - If no internet → Shows "Cannot connect" ✅
